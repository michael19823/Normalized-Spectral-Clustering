# Normalized Spectral Clustering
this project implement a version of the normalized spectral clustering algorithm.
it includes generation of data, visualization and implementing a well known clustering algorithm with all of its components.


1. The user executes the program with certain arguments using the invoke library.
2. The program will generate random points that will be used for clustering.
3. The program will compute the clusters using two algorithms: the Normalized Spectral
Clustering and K-means.

4. The program will output:
• A file with the resulting clusters from both algorithms.
• A file containing the data points that were used.
• A visualization file comparing the resulting clusters of the two algorithms.
